							<h1>Time Management App</h1>
					    	</a>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/summary proj images/karendeep.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>The student group successfully developed a time management app designed to help users organize their schedules and boost productivity. They started the project by identifying common challenges students face when managing their time, such as procrastination, missed deadlines, and ineffective planning.</p>

<p>Each member of the group took on specific roles, including research, design, coding, and testing. They researched existing time management apps to understand what features worked well and what could be improved. Based on their findings, they brainstormed features for their app, such as task lists, reminders, and calendar integration.</p>

<p>The design team created user-friendly layouts and interfaces, focusing on simplicity and ease of use. Meanwhile, the coding team built the app using programming languages and frameworks they had learned in class, ensuring it was functional across different devices.</p>

<p>After completing the initial development, the group conducted thorough testing to identify and fix any bugs. They gathered feedback from classmates to make improvements and ensure the app met user needs.</p>

<p>Once the app was ready, they presented it to their class, showcasing its features and benefits. The group gained valuable experience in teamwork and project management while creating a useful tool that could help students better manage their time and improve their academic performance.</p>
